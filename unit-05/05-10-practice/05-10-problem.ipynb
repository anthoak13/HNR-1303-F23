    "In this assessment, you will answer questions about machine learning and interprate the results of machine learning models.\n",

    "Scores are determined by:\n",

    "- Successfully starting the C Level = 50 pts\n",
    "- Perfectly completing the C Level = 75 pts\n",
    "- Perfectly completing the B and C Levels = 85 pts\n",

    "You may use your Colab notebooks, and any links to web sites I provide. (You may not use any other person or web site or book or resource, in general. This includes any discussion with classmates or other people on the subject matter.) **You should only make a single copy of this assessment**, and then edit just that copy.\n",

    "You may ask me for help **once**; however, you may ask for clarification as often as needed.\n",

    "Add additional cells for both code and markdown as needed. **Write answers to questions in narrative form in markdown.** You may print values you need in your code, and then use these values in a written response. All answers should be in the form of markdown or graphs. **Show all your work.** Calculations should be done in code cells instead of on a calculator.\n",

The challenge with a neural network is ensuring that the function the model is approximating is the *right* function and not something unrelated to our problem. A [classic example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9674813/) of this is a network that was trained to recognize cancerous growths on skin. The issue was the model actually learned to differentiate between pictures with a scale and pictures without a scale.
