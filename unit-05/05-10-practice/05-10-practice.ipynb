    "In this assessment, you will answer questions about machine learning and interprate the results of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores are determined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successfully starting the C Level = 50 pts\n",
    "- Perfectly completing the C Level = 75 pts\n",
    "- Perfectly completing the B and C Levels = 85 pts\n",
    "- Perfectly completing the A, B, and C Levels = 100 pts\n",

    "You may use your Colab notebooks, and any links to web sites I provide. (You may not use any other person or web site or book or resource, in general. This includes any discussion with classmates or other people on the subject matter.) **You should only make a single copy of this assessment**, and then edit just that copy. We will discuss this bit and class and may make some changes.\n",

    "Add additional cells for both code and markdown as needed. **Write answers to questions in narrative form in markdown.** You may print values you need in your code, and then use these values in a written response. All answers should be in the form of markdown or graphs. **Show all your work.** Calculations should be done in code cells instead of on a calculator.\n",
