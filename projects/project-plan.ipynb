Before Thanksgiving break (probably Monday the 20th) we will have a \"speed dating\" round where you will give your elevator pitch to all of your classmates and fill out a form expressing intrest in the different project ideas pitched. Based on everyones intrest I will make groups. You can also argue a case for why you should work on the project as an individual rather than part of a pair."
