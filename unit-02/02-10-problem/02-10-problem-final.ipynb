    "We have seen a few ways to estimate the irrational number $\\pi$ using a Monte Carlo simulation. $\\pi$ is not the only important irrational number that crops up all over the place in statistics and mathmatics. The other big player is [$e$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)). It is sometimes called the natural number (it's the base of the natural logarithm $\\ln$) or Euler's number and has a value of approximatly $2.718$. You've seen $e$ before in the definition of a Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like $\\pi$ we can estimate its value using a Monte Carlo simulation. Unfortunatly, unlike most ways of estimating $\\pi$ there is not an good geometric interpretation of this method. Instead, we will exploit the fact that if we generate a series of random numbers, all between $[0, 1)$, you need to  add (on average) $e$ random numbers before  the sum exceeds 1. \n",
    "\n",

    "A club on HPU's campus has decided to run a fundraiser and they need to earn $2000 to launch a new innitiative on campus. It's already been decided that the fundraiser is going to be based on the old [Pinko](https://priceisright.fandom.com/wiki/Plinko) game from The Price Is Right. Your job is to model the game and predict the expected earnings of the fundraiser. This game is a version of a Galton Board. A video of one of these boards in actions, along with a brief description of the model we are developing here, can be found in the introduction to [Grant Sanderson's video on the Central Limit Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo&t=113s). A shorter video of just the board can be found [here](https://youtu.be/EvHiee7gs9Y?t=9).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fundraiser, people will buy balls to drop down the Galton board. They will win an amount of money that depends on where the ball lands at the base of the board. The base of the board is broken up into four colored section: purple, red, green, and blue. Each section pays out a different amount of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the ball falls, it bounces off pegs in the board. We will assume that after hitting a peg, the ball will either bounce one unit of distance to the right or one unit of distance to the left. The board is constructed so the falling ball hits 10 pegs before reaching the base of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model the fall of each ball as a random walk, which each step in the walk represents the ball bounding off a peg in a row. We can track the position of the ball as it falls starting at the origin `x=0`. As it falls, it has a 50% chance of bouncing right and a 50% chance of bouncing left. We then update the position of the ball depending on the result. After bouncing 10 times we record the final position of the ball. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have written most of the model for you below. Run the code. The output is a histogram showing where each ball hit the base of the board. Look at the output and make sure you understand what it is showing. Then read over the code and answer the questions below."

    "Your roommate has joined the [Dungons and Dragons (D&D) club on campus](https://involved.highpoint.edu/organization/ttrpg) and decided to play as a Wizard. Overwelmed with all the spell options, they've come to you for help. Knowing you are in this class, they've asked you to help them model out part of a combat encounter. They've identified two spells in particular and want to know which spell will, on average, damage a single enemy more. The two spells are [Magic Missile](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-missile) and [Thunderwave](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:thunderwave).\n",

    "\n",
    "Thunderwave is a little more complicated. Most spells in D&D require sucessfully passing some kind of check before the spell can proceed. These checks always involve rolling of a d20. In the case of thunderwave, the spell always hits with 2d8 damage, but the enemy has a chance to dodge half of that damage. To check if the enemy sucessfully dodges, the enemy rolls a d20 and adds their Dexterity modifier to their roll. The dexterity modifier is a fixed number between -5 and +5 that represents how dexterous they are. Their total is then compared to the number 12 (your roommate's spell save DC). If the enemy's roll is less than 12 they take the full damage. Otherwise they take half the damage.\n",
